  Getting started with level design can feel a bit daunting in the beginning. Fio's talk will cover how to approach it at an early stage, so that you have a good and solid base to work with later on. After the presentation, there will be time for play testing and networking.  


  Please note: This time, we meet at 18:30 at the Nerdpol Caf√© on Bautzner Str. 
  
  The talk will start at 19:00. 
  

  Looking forward to seeing you there! :)
