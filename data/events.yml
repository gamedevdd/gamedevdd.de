  In our upcoming meetup, betalars will give a presentation about trauma in games. How are they triggered and how can you avoid triggering them? How can they be presented in games as part of the concept? 


  Since this topic is very sensitive, we advise those who would not like to participate to join us around 19:30 when the talk is over. Please remember to contact someone (e.g.Tino or me via Discord) to let you in at the main entrance. 
  
  
  See you there! :)
