  ✧・ﾟ: *✧・ﾟ:* *:・ﾟ✧*:・ﾟ✧ | We are hosting our hybrid jam this November! | ✧・ﾟ: *✧・ﾟ:* *:・ﾟ✧*:・ﾟ✧
  
  The jam will start on November 4th and submissions will be open until the Meetup on November 25th.
  This jam is open to beginners and there will be no ranking in the end. Feedback is still very welcome, of course. 
  The kickoff will be a virtual event on our Discord server, the recap will be held during the Meetup. We want to host a couple of optional status meetings, either virtual or in person. Details on this will follow. 
  
  All information can also be found on our Discord server:

  Looking forward to seeing you there! :)
